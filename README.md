This repository contains Matlab code to generate DMD stimuli. They are used
with [ViALUX](https://www.vialux.de/en/index.html) products such as the
[V-Modules](https://www.vialux.de/en/v-modules.html).

The stimuli are:
- [`natural_full_field`](sources/natural_full_field.m) which is a natural
  full-field stimulus, its generation is based on a natural image
- [`euler_full_field`](sources/euler_full_field.m) which is a synthetic
  full-field stimulus, it contains a step, a chirp in frequency and a chirp
  in amplitude
